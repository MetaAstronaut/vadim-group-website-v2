## ✅ DESIGN BEST PRACTICES

### DO:
- ✅ Use high-contrast text (white on dark, dark on light)
- ✅ Keep important text away from edges (safe zone: 100px from edges)
- ✅ Use high-quality images (no pixelation)
- ✅ Include your logo
- ✅ Add phone number (builds trust)
- ✅ Keep text large and readable (minimum 40px for body text)
- ✅ Test on mobile (will be cropped to square in some places)
- ✅ Use brand colors consistently
- ✅ Show actual work photos when possible

### DON'T:
- ❌ Use too much text (max 20-30 words)
- ❌ Use tiny fonts (nothing under 24px)
- ❌ Put text on busy backgrounds without overlay
- ❌ Use stock photos that look fake
- ❌ Include too many colors (stick to 2-3)
- ❌ Use clipart or low-quality graphics
- ❌ Forget the phone number or website
- ❌ Use images with other companies' logos
