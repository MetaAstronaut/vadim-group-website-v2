# Frequently Asked Questions

**Last Updated:** November 17, 2025

## What types of repairs do you handle? {#repair-types}

We handle a wide range of home, marine, and RV repairs within a light to moderate scope, including walls, ceilings, surfaces, light structural corrections, water damage, and light electrical work.

We also provide specialized services for complex projects like structural repairs, water damage restoration, storm damage, and custom carpentry.

---

## How quickly can you respond to an urgent issue? {#response-time}

Response time depends on current workload, but urgent issues are treated as a priority. In many cases, we can schedule a visit within a short time frame once we review your request.

For true emergencies (active leaks, safety hazards), we prioritize scheduling to provide help as quickly as possible.

---

## Do you provide estimates before starting work? {#estimates}

Yes. After reviewing your request and, if needed, visiting the site, we provide a clear estimate so you know what to expect before any work begins.

All estimates are transparent with no hidden costs.

---

## What materials do you use? {#materials}

We use appropriate, professional-grade materials suited to each task, whether it's interior repair, exterior restoration, marine work, or RV repair. 

The goal is always durability and long-term performance. We can discuss specific material choices during the estimate phase.

---

## Do you work with boats and RVs? {#marine-rv}

Yes. We provide light to moderate repairs and restoration for both marine structures and RV interiors/exteriors within our defined scope.

This includes gelcoat repair, deck restoration, interior cabin work, water damage treatment, and light electrical troubleshooting.

---

## Are repairs guaranteed? {#guarantee}

We stand behind the quality of our work. If you have concerns after a repair is completed, you can contact us and we will review the situation and discuss next steps.

Our goal is always long-lasting, reliable repairs.

For smaller projects, payment is typically due upon completion. For larger projects, we may discuss a deposit structure.

All payment terms are clearly communicated before work begins.
