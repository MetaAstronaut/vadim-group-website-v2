# Home Repairs & Restoration

## Introduction

Vadim Group provides high-skill residential repairs and restoration for homeowners who want the job done correctly the first time. We focus on long-lasting solutions, not temporary fixes.

## General Repairs

We can restore the look and function of your home’s interior and exterior.

- Wall and ceiling repair
- Surface patching and finishing
- Interior and exterior painting and touch-ups
- Trim, doors, and hardware repair

Whether it is a small hole in the wall or a room that needs a full refresh, we handle the details with care.

## Structural & Safety (Light Scope)

Some problems go deeper than the surface. We address light structural and safety-related issues within a non-hazardous scope.

- Light structural corrections
- Wood rot removal and restoration
- Small framing repairs
- Reinforcement of weakened areas

If you notice soft spots, sagging, or damaged wood, we can inspect and recommend the right repair.

## Water Damage & Moisture

Water issues can quickly become expensive if ignored. We help identify and repair damage caused by leaks and moisture.

- Drywall replacement due to leaks
- Restoration of moisture-affected areas
- Kitchen and bathroom leak-related repairs
- Basic identification of the source of damage

We focus on proper restoration to help prevent recurring problems.

## Light Electrical Work

We handle light electrical tasks that commonly appear during repair work.

- Light fixture replacement
- Outlet and switch repair
- Minor electrical troubleshooting

For complex electrical systems, we may recommend a dedicated electrician, but we can solve many common issues as part of your repair project.

Your home’s exterior is constantly exposed to weather and wear. We provide targeted repairs to protect and refresh your property.

- Fence and gate repairs
- Deck repairs and refinishing (light scope)
