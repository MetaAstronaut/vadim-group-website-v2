### HOME CARE EDUCATION
# Why Homes Need Regular Repairs
Every home, regardless of quality or age, requires ongoing maintenance and repairs. Understanding why repairs are necessary helps homeowners make informed decisions and budget appropriately.

Common Causes of Home Repair Needs:

1. **Wear and Tear** - Daily use gradually degrades materials, finishes, and mechanical systems
2. **Weather Exposure** - Sun, rain, wind, humidity, and temperature fluctuations affect exterior and interior elements
3. **Settling** - Homes naturally settle over time, causing minor cracks and alignment issues
4. **Material Degradation** - Wood rots, metal corrodes, rubber seals crack, and paint fades
5. **System Aging** - Plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems have limited lifespans
6. **Improper Installation** - Previous substandard work often reveals itself over time
7. **Neglect** - Deferred maintenance leads to compound problems

**The Cost of Waiting:**
Delaying repairs often leads to exponentially higher costs. Small leaks become mold outbreaks. Minor cracks become structural problems. Early action prevents expensive damage.
