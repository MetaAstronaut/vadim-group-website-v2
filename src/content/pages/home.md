## How Our Repair Process Works

1. **Request & Assessment**  
   You send details or photos of the problem, and we review the situation.

2. **On-Site Inspection**  
   We visit your property, boat, or RV to identify the true root cause.

3. **Clear Estimate**  
   You receive a clear, transparent estimate with no hidden costs.

4. **Repair & Restoration**  
   Work is done correctly the first time, using appropriate materials and methods.

5. **Cleanup & Quality Review**  
   The workspace is left clean, and the result is reviewed together.

6. **Follow-Up**  
   We remain available for questions and future support.
