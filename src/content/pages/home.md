### QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

## Questions We Hear Most Often

**How much does a typical home repair cost?**
Home repair costs vary based on the scope of work, materials needed, and labor time. Minor repairs like fixing a leaky faucet typically range from $150-$300, while larger projects like drywall repair can range from $300-$1,500. We provide transparent, detailed estimates before beginning any work so you know exactly what to expect.

**How quickly can you respond to repair requests?**
For standard repairs, we typically schedule within 2-5 business days. Emergency repairs receive same-day or next-day service depending on availability. We understand that some issues can't wait, and we prioritize urgent situations accordingly.

**Do you offer warranties on your work?**
Absolutely. We stand behind every repair with a comprehensive workmanship warranty. Specific warranty terms vary by project type, but we ensure that all repairs are completed to the highest standards and will last for years to come.

**Can you handle both small repairs and large renovations?**
Yes! No job is too small or too large for The Vadim Group. Whether you need a single outlet replaced or a complete home renovation, we approach every project with the same dedication to quality and customer satisfaction.

**Do I need to be home during the repair?**
It depends on the project. For some repairs, we can work independently after an initial consultation. For others, we may need access or input throughout the process. We'll discuss the specifics during scheduling and work around your availability.

**What if the problem is worse than initially thought?**
Transparency is one of our core values. If we discover additional issues during a repair, we'll stop work, document the problem, and provide you with options and pricing before proceeding. You'll never receive surprise charges.

**How do I know what repairs to prioritize?**
During our initial assessment, we'll help you identify which repairs are urgent (safety or structural concerns), important (preventing further damage), and desirable (aesthetic improvements). We'll provide honest recommendations based on your budget and goals.

If you don’t see your question here, just send a quick message — we’re happy to clarify.
